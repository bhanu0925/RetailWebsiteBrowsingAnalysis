# RetailWebsiteBrowsingAnalysis

**Website Behavior Analysis - A Supervised Learning Case study**

**Problem:**
The client is an online ecommerce player. They have shared a user level log data for their browsing behavior (Timestamp, UserId and website section visited). You have been provided with the final conversion data too (Timestamp, UserID, Products Purchased in the transaction, Overall Cart Value).

**Task:** Based on this data you are required to build features and model on these characteristics of users to calculate a score/rank for conversion probability of that user. These scores will eventually decide the bidding logic used for each user. Your model will be evaluated on these criteria: -

a. Feature Engineering (Variable Imputation)

b. Model Selection Criteria (Basis of choosing the final Technique)

c. Measurement Criteria (Comparison of Various Models)

d. Scope for improvement 

**Data**

Timestamp - Time duration of customer using the website

UserID - User if of the customer

Website_section_visited - Website sections visited by the user

Products_Purchased - Product purchased by the user

Cart_Value - cart value of each customers

**Objective:**

To build a predictive regression model which predict the probability of a user buying a product, based on the characteristics of user observed from the website browsing history data.
